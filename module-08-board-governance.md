## 📖 Core Concepts

### 8.1 — What Is a Board of Directors?

A **board of directors** is the governing body of a corporation. It holds ultimate authority over the company — above the CEO, above the management team, above any individual investor.

The board's key responsibilities:
- Hiring and firing the CEO
- Approving major strategic decisions (acquisitions, major funding rounds, strategic pivots)
- Fiduciary duty to shareholders
- Setting executive compensation
- Ensuring legal and financial compliance

> 💡 **The CEO reports to the board.** This is a structural reality many first-time founders underestimate. You can be the founder, the product visionary, and the public face of the company — and still be replaced by a vote of the board.

---

### 8.2 — Types of Board Members

**Founder Directors**
The founders who built the company. They typically have the strongest operational knowledge and long-term vision — and the most to lose emotionally.

**Investor Directors**
Representatives appointed by VC investors as part of their investment terms. They represent their fund's interests, which may or may not align perfectly with founder interests.

> ⚠️ **Important nuance:** Most VC board members are thoughtful, experienced, and genuinely try to help. But they do have a fiduciary duty to their fund's LPs — not to the founders. When those interests diverge, the VC director may have to act against the founder's preference.

**Independent Directors**
Neither founders nor investors. Typically experienced executives, former CEOs, or domain experts. They are meant to serve as neutral third parties who can break ties and bring unbiased perspective.

The **quality** of independent directors matters enormously. A well-chosen independent can prevent board dysfunction; a poor choice can exacerbate it.

**Observer Seats**
Some investors — typically smaller check writers — receive observer seats instead of full board seats. Observers can attend board meetings and listen, but they cannot vote. This is a common concession that gives an investor "information rights" without giving them formal governance power.

---

### 8.3 — Board Composition Across Stages

As the company grows, the board evolves:

| Stage | Typical Size | Typical Composition |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Pre-Seed/Seed | 1–3 | Founders only (or + 1 investor) |
| Series A | 5 | 2 founders + 2 investors + 1 independent |
| Series B | 5–7 | 2 founders + 2–3 investors + 1–2 independents |
| Series C+ | 7–9 | Negotiated — often investor-heavy |

> 🚨 **The control cliff:** Early on, founders control the board. After Series A, you often have a 2-2-1 split — an even board with a neutral fifth member as tiebreaker. After Series B, investors can start to outnumber founders. This is when governance gets complicated.

---

### 8.4 — Governance Documents That Shape Power

Several documents created at fundraising determine board authority before any conflict arises:

**Certificate of Incorporation**
The foundational company document. It defines share classes, voting rights, and authorized share count.

**Voting Agreement**
Specifies who has the right to elect directors to each board seat. Founders elect "Founder Directors," investors elect "Investor Directors," and sometimes everyone votes together on "Independent Directors."

**Investors' Rights Agreement**
Defines investor rights including information rights, pro-rata rights, and registration rights.

**Protective Provisions**
(Covered in Module 05) — the veto rights that investors hold over specific actions.

> 💡 **Why governance documents matter:** In a dispute, these documents determine who wins. A founder who doesn't read them carefully — or doesn't have a lawyer who does — can be blindsided when a conflict arises.

---

### 8.5 — Running an Effective Board Meeting

Most founders dread board meetings. They shouldn't — a well-run board meeting is one of the best tools a founder has for getting strategic help and accountability.

**Anatomy of a good board meeting:**

**Before the meeting:**
- Send the board package at least 3 days before (never the night before)
- Include: Financial summary, key metrics, roadblocks, decisions needed
- Make it clear which items need decisions vs. which are informational

**During the meeting (typical agenda):**
1. **Approve minutes from last meeting** (5 min)
2. **Financial update** (15 min)
3. **Key metrics review** (15 min)
4. **Progress against plan** (20 min)
5. **Strategic discussion / key decisions** (30 min)
6. **Fundraising / investor relations update** (15 min)
7. **Other items / Q&A** (15 min)
8. **Closed session (board only, no management)** (15 min)

**The board package should include:**
- P&L vs. budget
- Key metrics dashboard (revenue, growth, burn, runway)
- Team updates (headcount, key hires, departures)
- Product roadmap progress
- Competitive landscape notes
- Specific questions you want the board's input on

> 💡 **The #1 mistake founders make in board meetings:** Spending too much time reporting on what happened, and not enough time asking for help with what's coming. Your board can't help you if they're spending 90% of the meeting processing information.

### 8.6 — Board Dysfunction: Warning Signs

Boards can go wrong in many ways. Here are the warning signs:

**❌ Investors micromanaging operations**
Board members should govern, not manage. When a board member starts dictating hiring decisions or product features, the governance relationship has broken down.

**❌ Founders hiding bad news**
Boards that only hear good news are useless. The first sign a founder is in trouble is when they start presenting selectively. Investors can usually tell.

**❌ Misaligned incentives around timing**
An investor whose fund is expiring might push for an early exit just as the company is hitting its stride. A founder who refuses any exit conversation might hold on too long. These tensions are normal but must be surfaced and discussed openly.

**❌ 2-2 deadlock**
On a 4-person board, equal founder-investor splits create paralysis. The independent director selection becomes the most important decision in the company.

**❌ Over-scheduled or under-scheduled boards**
Meeting quarterly is too infrequent for a fast-moving startup. Meeting monthly can consume too much management bandwidth. For most companies, **5–6 board meetings per year** is appropriate.

---

### 8.7 — How Founders Lose Control

Understanding this is critical — not to be paranoid, but to be informed.

**Mechanism 1: Dilution across rounds**
Each funding round dilutes founder equity. After Series A, B, and C, founders might own 15–20% of the company. This is fine economically but reduces voting power.

**Mechanism 2: Board seat concessions**
Each round often comes with an investor board seat. Founders who don't negotiate carefully can end up outnumbered.

**Mechanism 3: Super-voting structures (or lack thereof)**
Some founders protect themselves with dual-class share structures that give founders 10x or more votes per share (Facebook, Google, Snap). Others don't — and lose control through dilution.

**Mechanism 4: Performance failures**
The most common reason founders are replaced. If the company seriously underperforms, the board has both the right and the obligation to make a leadership change.

> 💡 **Dual-class shares:** Some founders negotiate for "supervoting" rights — shares that carry 10 votes each instead of 1. Mark Zuckerberg holds ~36% of Facebook equity but controls ~58% of the voting power due to Class B shares. This is available to founders with enough leverage, usually at Series B or later. It's worth knowing about — but most early-stage founders don't have the leverage to demand it.

## 🌍 Real-World Case Study: Travis Kalanick & Uber's Board Battle

**Background:** Travis Kalanick co-founded Uber in 2009 and built it into the most valuable private company in the world. By 2017, Uber was worth ~$70 billion. He was also, by most accounts, a polarizing and at times difficult leader.

**The Events of 2017:**
- A series of crises hit Uber in rapid succession: allegations of systemic sexual harassment at the company, a viral video of Kalanick berating a driver, a damaging investigation of Uber's corporate culture, and a legal battle with Waymo over alleged trade secret theft.
- Uber's board (which included prominent VCs including Benchmark) commissioned an investigation by former Attorney General Eric Holder.

**The Board Coup:**
In June 2017, five major Uber investors sent a letter demanding Kalanick's resignation. Kalanick was on a leave of absence following a family tragedy. He resigned within days.

The key: Uber's Series C and D term sheets had granted investors enough board power and protective provision coverage that they had the legal authority to act. Kalanick had not protected himself with super-voting shares.

**The Aftermath:**
Kalanick eventually sold most of his Uber stake for billions of dollars. He later founded a new company (CloudKitchens). Uber went public in 2019 and is now worth ~$150B+.

**What This Teaches:**
1. Board dynamics are not theoretical — they determine whether you keep the company you built
2. Investor directors have a fiduciary duty to their funds — when the pressure was on, they acted in their fund's perceived interest
3. Legal governance structures matter before any crisis hits
4. Even the most successful founders are not immune to board removal
5. None of this means VCs are villains — most would argue (and have) that the decision was in the company's best interest

> 🤔 **Reflection Question:** If you were Travis Kalanick in 2015 (Uber's height of growth), what governance decisions would you have made differently, with the benefit of hindsight?

## 🔬 Lab Exercise: Design a Board Structure

**Objective:** Given a startup scenario, design a board structure and a sample board meeting agenda.

**Time:** 30–45 minutes

---

**Part 1: Board Design**

"BioNova" is a Series A health tech startup. They raised $8M at a $30M pre-money valuation from lead investor "Frontier Ventures." They have two founders (CEO and CTO) and one prior angel investor who has been supportive and helpful.

**Questions:**
1. Design the initial Series A board structure. How many seats? Who fills each one?
2. What type of person should the independent director be? List 3 criteria for selecting them.
3. The founders are worried about losing control. What governance protection could they negotiate?
4. At Series B, Frontier Ventures brings in a new co-investor who wants a board seat. How does the board structure change? Is this a concern?

---

**Part 2: Board Meeting Agenda**

BioNova's CEO needs to prepare for their first board meeting after Series A. The company:
- Has $2.1M ARR growing 25% MoM
- Burn rate is $320K/month (12-month runway remaining)
- Has 3 open senior roles (VP Sales, Head of Engineering, Head of Marketing)
- Is facing a new competitor who just raised $15M
- Needs board approval to sign a $500K enterprise contract that requires a 3-year SaaS commitment

**Your Task:** Write a 1-page board meeting agenda (60–90 minute meeting) that:
- Covers the most important topics
- Includes a decision item (the enterprise contract)
- Allocates time appropriately
- Ends with a closed-session

## 🔁 Module Summary (TL;DR)

The board of directors has ultimate authority over the company — including the power to fire the CEO. Boards evolve from founder-controlled at seed to more balanced at Series A to potentially investor-heavy at later stages. Governance documents negotiated at each funding round determine who holds power. Founders protect themselves through super-voting shares, careful board seat negotiation, and transparent communication. A well-run board meeting is a strategic tool — use it to get help, not just to report results.
