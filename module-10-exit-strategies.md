## 📖 Core Concepts

### 10.1 — Why Exits Matter

Every party in the startup ecosystem — VCs, founders, early employees, angel investors — ultimately gets paid through an exit event.

**No exit = no liquidity.** Unlike public stocks you can sell any Tuesday, private company shares are illiquid. You can't sell them until a "liquidity event" occurs.

**The three ways to exit:**

| Exit Type | Who Buys | Best For | Typical Size |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Acquisition (M&A) | Corporations, PE firms | Any stage | $5M – $100B+ |
| IPO | Public market investors | Large, scaled companies | $500M+ valuation typically |
| Secondary Sale | Other investors, funds | Individual shareholders | Varies |

### 10.2 — Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)

An **acquisition** is when another company buys your company — either for its technology, team, customers, revenue, or market position.

**Types of acquisitions:**

#### Strategic Acquisition
The buyer wants your product, customers, or market position because it fits their business strategy.

> Example: Adobe tried to acquire Figma (design software) for $20 billion in 2022 because Figma was threatening Adobe's Creative Cloud. (The deal was ultimately blocked by EU regulators.) The price reflected the *strategic value* to Adobe, far beyond what Figma's standalone financials might justify.

#### Acqui-Hire
The buyer primarily wants your *team* — the product and business may be shut down. Common when a startup has great engineers but a product that isn't working.

> Acqui-hire prices range from a few million to $50M+, often structured as retention packages for key employees rather than equity payouts for investors.

#### Financial Acquisition (Private Equity)
A PE firm buys the company not for strategic fit, but as a financial investment — often by improving operations and selling again in 5–7 years.

**The M&A Process:**

1. **Inbound or Outbound Interest** — Either the acquirer approaches you, or your banker/advisor introduces you
2. **NDA + Preliminary Discussions** — Share high-level information under confidentiality
3. **Letter of Intent (LOI)** — Non-binding agreement on price and structure
4. **Due Diligence** — Buyer examines everything: financials, legal, technical, HR (takes 4–12 weeks)
5. **Definitive Agreement** — Binding legal contracts
6. **Closing** — Money transfers, company changes hands

**Deal Structures:**

**Cash Deal:** Simplest. You get cash at closing. This is what most founders and employees want.

**Stock Deal:** You receive shares of the acquiring company instead of cash. You're now betting on the acquirer's stock price. Risk: If the acquirer's stock drops, your payout decreases.

**Earnout:** Part of the payment is contingent on future performance. You get paid full price only if the company hits certain milestones post-acquisition. Risk: The acquirer may (intentionally or not) constrain the business in ways that make hitting those milestones harder.

> 🚨 **Earnouts are controversial.** Many founders who've lived through them say the earnout targets are met in spirit but not in letter, and they end up receiving less than expected. Negotiate earnouts carefully — or push for cash instead.

**The Waterfall: Who Gets Paid What in an M&A**

This is where everything from earlier modules comes together. The order of payments in an acquisition:

```
Acquisition Price
     │
     ▼
1. Transaction costs (lawyers, bankers, advisors)
     │
     ▼
2. Senior debt / creditors (if any)
     │
     ▼
3. Preferred shareholders (investors) — liquidation preference
     │
     ▼
4. Preferred shareholders participate (if participating preferred)
     │
     ▼
5. Common shareholders (founders, employees) — whatever remains
```

**Example:**
- Company acquired for $30M
- Preferred investors hold $10M of 1x non-participating preferred
- Investors own 30% on a fully diluted basis
- Founders + employees own 70%

**Math:**
- At $30M exit: 1x preference = $10M. Pro-rata (30% × $30M) = $9M. Preference is higher.
  - Investors take $10M via preference
  - Remaining $20M goes to common: **founders/employees split $20M**

*Now re-run this with 2x participating preferred (as in the NovaTech term sheet from Module 05) and see the difference.*

### 10.3 — Initial Public Offering (IPO)

An **IPO** is when a company sells shares to the public on a stock exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.) for the first time.

**Why companies go public:**
- Raise large amounts of capital at scale
- Provide liquidity for founders, employees, and investors
- Increase company credibility and brand
- Enable stock-based acquisitions (acquirer uses their stock to buy others)
- Meet investor return expectations (VCs need exits)

**Why companies *don't* go public (or delay):**
- Public companies face intense scrutiny and regulatory burden (Sarbanes-Oxley, SEC filings)
- Quarterly earnings pressure can distort long-term thinking
- Founders lose significant control (public shareholders can sell stock, short stock, sue the company)
- Staying private longer allows more flexibility

**The IPO Process:**

1. **Choose Underwriters** — Investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley) who structure and market the IPO
2. **S-1 Filing** — Confidential registration statement filed with the SEC (this is the document WeWork's problems were exposed in)
3. **Roadshow** — Founders pitch to institutional investors to build demand
4. **Pricing** — Final share price is set, based on investor demand
5. **IPO Day** — Shares begin trading on the exchange
6. **Lock-Up Period** — Founders and early investors typically cannot sell for 180 days post-IPO

**Alternative IPO paths:**

**Direct Listing:** Skip the underwriters and list directly on an exchange. Spotify and Coinbase did this. No new shares are issued — only existing shareholders can sell. Less expensive, but no new capital raised.

**SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company):** A blank-check company raises money in an IPO, then merges with a private company to take it public. Very popular in 2020–2021, fell out of favor by 2022–2023 due to poor performance.

---

### 10.4 — Secondary Sales

A **secondary sale** is when a founder, early investor, or employee sells their shares to another private investor — without the company itself being acquired or going public.

**Who buys secondary shares?**
- **Secondary funds** (Forge Global, Nasdaq Private Market)
- **New investors** who want exposure before IPO
- **Existing investors** who want to increase their stake
- **Crossover funds** (institutional investors who bridge public and private markets)

**Why founders do secondary sales:**
- Personal liquidity — you've been working for years; you want to take some money off the table
- Reduce personal financial risk — diversify away from a single concentrated position
- Life events — you need cash for a home, medical bills, kids' education

> 💡 **The "take some chips off the table" concept:** Many successful investors and advisors explicitly encourage founders to sell 10–20% of their personal holdings in a secondary at Series B or C. The logic: you can make enough money to feel financially secure, reduce the desperation that can distort decision-making, and still have enormous upside if the company continues to grow.

**Limitations of secondary sales:**
- Not always available — the company must approve secondary transactions (ROFR provisions)
- Share price may be set at a discount to the last round
- Can send a signal to investors (why is the founder selling?)

### 10.5 — Strategic Exit Planning: When to Start Thinking About It

The best time to start thinking about your exit is **before you raise your first dollar.**

Not because you need to have an answer — but because understanding how exits work shapes every decision that follows.

**Questions to consider early:**

1. **Who are the natural buyers?** If you build a SaaS HR tool, the likely buyers are companies like Workday, SAP, or Oracle. Understanding the buyer landscape helps you build the right features and relationships.

2. **What exit size makes everyone whole?** If you've raised $30M across three rounds, with investors holding $30M in liquidation preferences, a $25M acquisition pays investors but nothing to founders. Know your numbers.

3. **IPO or M&A?** Some companies are built to be acquired; others are built to be independent. Know which you're building.

4. **What are your investors' timelines?** A VC fund in Year 7 needs exits. If you're in their portfolio, they'll be pushing. Understand their timeline to avoid misaligned expectations.

5. **What do you personally need?** Financial independence? To see the product reach its full vision? To build an enduring company? Your personal goals should influence the exit strategy.

## 🌍 Real-World Case Study: The Figma Story — From $0 to $20B

**Background:** Dylan Field and Evan Wallace started Figma in 2012 as a browser-based design tool. They wanted to make design collaborative — something Sketch and Adobe products at the time were not.

**The Fundraising Journey:**
- Seed: $3.8M (2014)
- Series A: $14M (2015)
- Series B: $25M (2018)
- Series C: $40M (2019)
- Series D: $50M (2020)
- Series E: $200M at a $10B valuation (2021)

**The Adobe Acquisition Attempt (2022):**
In September 2022, Adobe announced it would acquire Figma for **$20 billion** — half cash, half stock. This was the largest acquisition in design software history, and one of the largest in SaaS history.

**Why Adobe Paid $20B:**
- Figma was growing at 100%+ year-over-year
- Figma's collaborative model was a direct threat to Adobe's entire product portfolio
- Adobe knew they couldn't build this themselves fast enough
- The market was pricing Figma as if it would be worth $50B+ as a standalone public company

**The Regulatory Block:**
In December 2023, both the UK's CMA and the EU's European Commission blocked the deal on competition grounds, arguing it would harm innovation in design software. Adobe terminated the deal and paid Figma a **$1 billion termination fee**.

**What Happened After the Blocked Deal:**
Figma remained an independent company. Its valuation is debated, but it's widely considered worth $10–15B+ on a standalone basis. They are now considered a likely IPO candidate.

**What This Teaches:**
1. The highest exit price isn't always the one that closes — regulatory risk is real
2. Strategic acquirers will pay massive premiums for companies that threaten their core business
3. Having a strong independent path gives you leverage in exit negotiations
4. The $1B termination fee itself validated Figma's value and gave them additional capital
5. Sometimes being blocked from an acquisition is the beginning of an even better story

> 🤔 **Reflection Question:** If you were Dylan Field after the blocked acquisition, what would your next three decisions be? Would you pursue another acquisition, go public, or remain private?

## 🔬 Lab Exercise: Exit Scenario Modeling

**Objective:** Model three exit scenarios for a fictional startup and calculate what each party receives.

**Time:** 45–60 minutes

**Use Google Sheets or Excel**

---

**Setup — "NovaTech" Cap Table (from Module 05, post-Series A):**

| Holder | Shares | Share Class | Investment | Liquidation Pref |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Alex (CEO) | 4,000,000 | Common | — | None |
| Jamie (CTO) | 3,000,000 | Common | — | None |
| Option Pool (employees) | 1,400,000 | Common | — | None |
| Seed VC | 2,000,000 | Preferred Series Seed | $1,500,000 | 1x non-participating |
| Series A VC | 2,600,000 | Preferred Series A | $5,000,000 | 1x non-participating |
| **Total** | **13,000,000** | | | |

**Total invested by VCs: $6,500,000**

---

**Scenario 1: Modest Exit — $15M Acquisition (Cash)**

1. Who has liquidation preferences? Total preference amount?
2. After paying preferences, what remains for common?
3. How much does each party receive?
4. How do founders feel about this outcome?

---

**Scenario 2: Good Exit — $50M Acquisition (Cash)**

1. Seed VC: preference ($1.5M) vs. pro-rata (15.4% × $50M = $7.7M). Which do they choose?
2. Series A VC: preference ($5M) vs. pro-rata (20% × $50M = $10M). Which do they choose?
3. After both VCs choose optimal payout, what's left for common?
4. How much does Alex (30.8% of common) and Jamie (23.1% of common) each receive?

---

**Scenario 3: Great Exit — $150M Acquisition (Cash)**

1. All preferred investors convert to common (pro-rata is higher)
2. Calculate everyone's payout on a fully diluted basis
3. How much do the employees who hold the 1.4M option pool shares receive?
4. Assuming employee average strike price of $1.50/share and share price at exit is $11.54/share ($150M ÷ 13M shares), what is their gross profit per option?

---

**Scenario 4: Down Exit — $8M Acquisition**

1. Total preference: $6.5M
2. After paying preferences, what remains for common?
3. What does Alex receive? What does Jamie receive?
4. Are the employee options in-the-money or out-of-the-money at this exit? (Strike price $1.50, exit price $0.62/share)

---

**Reflection Questions:**
1. At what exit price do founders first start making meaningful money?
2. How would the outcomes change if the Series A had participating preferred instead of non-participating?
3. What does this analysis tell you about why founders should care deeply about liquidation preference terms?

## 🔁 Module Summary (TL;DR)

Exits are the moment the entire VC ecosystem gets paid. The three paths are **M&A** (someone buys you), **IPO** (you go public), and **secondary sales** (individual shareholders sell to other investors). The exit waterfall — dictated by the liquidation preferences in your term sheets — determines *who gets what*. Strategic exit planning starts at company formation, not the week before you sign a deal. Understanding what acquirers value, what public markets reward, and how your cap table will play out in different scenarios is not pessimism — it's professionalism.
