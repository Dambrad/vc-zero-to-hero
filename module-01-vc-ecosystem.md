## 📖 Core Concepts

### 1.1 — What Is Venture Capital?

**The simple version:** Venture capital is a type of financing where investors give money to startups and early-stage companies in exchange for equity (ownership).

But here's the nuance most people miss: **VCs are not banks, and they are not charities.** They are professional investors who manage other people's money. Their job is to find companies that might grow extremely fast and return many times the original investment.

The math works like this: VCs know that most startups will fail. So the ones that succeed need to succeed *spectacularly* to make up for all the losses. A VC might invest in 20–30 companies expecting that:

- 15–18 will fail or return little
- 5–8 will do okay (1–3x return)
- 1–2 will be massive wins (50–100x return)

Those 1–2 massive wins pay for everything. This is called the **Power Law** — a small number of investments generate the vast majority of returns.

> 💡 **Key Insight:** VCs are not trying to find good businesses. They are trying to find *exceptional* businesses that can grow to be worth billions. A restaurant that does $5M/year in revenue might be a great business — but it will never be a VC-backed company.

### 1.2 — Who Are the Players?

Think of the VC world as a chain of relationships. Each link matters.

#### 🏦 Limited Partners (LPs)
LPs are the **money behind the money**. They are the investors who put capital into a VC fund. Common LPs include:

- University endowments (Harvard, Yale, Stanford)
- Pension funds (teachers' unions, public employee funds)
- Family offices (ultra-wealthy individuals managing generational wealth)
- Sovereign wealth funds (government investment funds, e.g., from Norway or Saudi Arabia)
- Corporations and financial institutions
- Successful founders and executives (high-net-worth individuals)

LPs **do not pick startups**. They give their money to a VC firm and trust the General Partners to invest it wisely.

#### 💼 General Partners (GPs)
GPs are the **venture capitalists** — the people you see on stage at conferences, in TechCrunch interviews, and across from founders in pitch meetings.

GPs are responsible for:
- Raising money from LPs
- Sourcing and evaluating startup investments
- Making investment decisions
- Sitting on boards and advising portfolio companies
- Helping return capital to LPs

> 🔑 **How GPs get paid — the "2 and 20" model:**
> - **2% Management Fee** — 2% of the fund size per year, used to pay salaries, rent, operations
> - **20% Carried Interest ("carry")** — 20% of *profits* from successful investments
>
> Example: A $100M fund charges $2M/year in fees. If the fund generates $300M in returns (a $200M profit), the GP firm takes 20% of that = **$40M in carry**. The LPs get the remaining 80% = **$160M**.

#### 🚀 Founders / Portfolio Companies
These are the startups that receive VC investment. Founders give up equity in exchange for capital, expertise, and network access.

#### 😇 Angel Investors
Angels are **individual investors** — often successful entrepreneurs or executives — who invest their own personal money into early-stage startups. They typically invest earlier than VCs ($25K–$500K range) and take more risk. Many angels invest before the company has revenue or even a product.

Angels are different from VCs in one important way: **they're investing their own money**, not managing a fund. This means they move faster and take more personal risk.

#### 🏢 Other Capital Sources (for context)

| Source | Stage | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Bootstrapping** | Any | Founder funds the company themselves |
| **Friends & Family** | Pre-seed | Informal, relationship-based |
| **Angel Investors** | Pre-seed/Seed | Personal money, quick decisions |
| **Accelerators** (YC, Techstars) | Pre-seed/Seed | Small check + program + network |
| **Venture Capital** | Seed through Growth | Institutional money, fund-based |
| **Corporate VC (CVC)** | Any | Strategic money from large corporations |
| **Private Equity** | Growth/Mature | Larger companies, often profitability-focused |
| **Debt / Venture Debt** | Growth | Loans, often alongside equity |
| **IPO** | Public | Listing on a stock exchange |

### 1.3 — The VC Fund Lifecycle

A VC fund is not permanent. It has a **defined lifespan**, usually 10 years, with two extensions of 1 year each possible.

**Phase 1: Fundraising (Year 0–1)**
The GP pitches LPs to commit capital to the new fund. Once enough is raised, the fund "closes" and investing begins.

**Phase 2: Investing Period (Years 1–5)**
The GP deploys capital into startups. This is the active phase of sourcing deals, doing due diligence, and making investments.

**Phase 3: Portfolio Management (Years 3–7)**
Companies are growing (or not). GPs sit on boards, help with hiring, make introductions, and guide strategy.

**Phase 4: Harvesting / Exits (Years 5–10)**
Companies either go public (IPO), get acquired (M&A), or fail. Successful exits return cash to LPs.

**Phase 5: Wind Down**
The fund distributes final proceeds and closes.

> ⏰ **Why this matters for founders:** VCs are on a clock. A fund that invested in your company in Year 3 needs to see a return before Year 10. This creates pressure. Knowing this dynamic helps you understand *why* your VC board member is pushing for growth or an exit.

### 1.4 — What VCs Actually Look For

Most VCs will tell you they look for "great teams, big markets, and strong traction." That's true — but it's incomplete.

Here's a more honest breakdown:

| Criterion | What VCs Want | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| **Market Size** | $1B+ addressable market | They need room for massive growth |
| **Team** | Exceptional founders | Most bets are on the jockey, not the horse |
| **Product/Technology** | Defensible advantage | Hard to replicate = better moat |
| **Traction** | Proof it works | Reduces risk; shows real demand |
| **Business Model** | Path to high margins | Software scales; restaurants don't |
| **Timing** | Right moment | Great idea 5 years too early = failure |

## 🌍 Real-World Case Study: How Sequoia Invested in Google

**The Setup:** In 1999, two Stanford PhD students — Larry Page and Sergey Brin — had built a search engine they called Google. It was technically impressive, but they didn't have a business model. In fact, they'd tried to sell the technology to Yahoo for $1 million and been turned down.

**The Investment:** Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins each invested $12.5 million into Google in June 1999, valuing the company at roughly $75 million (post-money). At the time, Google had almost no revenue.

**What the VCs Saw:**
- An extraordinary technical team (Stanford PhDs with real conviction)
- A product that was visibly better than anything else in search
- A market (internet search/advertising) that was enormous and growing
- A rare combination of technical depth and user focus

**What Happened Next:** Google's IPO in 2004 valued the company at $23 billion. Sequoia's $12.5M investment became worth roughly **$4 billion** — a 320x return.

**The Lesson:** VCs don't invest in certainties. They invest in *exceptional possibilities*. Google had no revenue, no business model, and had just been rejected by Yahoo. None of that stopped Sequoia. They saw the team, the technology, and the market — and that was enough.

> 🤔 **Reflection Question:** What would you have needed to see to invest $12.5M in a company with no revenue in 1999? What does that tell you about how VCs think about risk?

## ✅ Module 01 Checklist

Before moving to Module 02, make sure you can answer these without looking:

## 🔁 Module Summary (TL;DR)

Venture capital is **institutional risk capital** that funds high-growth startups in exchange for equity. VCs manage funds on behalf of LPs, charge management fees, and earn carried interest on profitable exits. The game is driven by the **Power Law** — a small number of massive wins fund everything else. Understanding who the players are and how they're incentivized is the foundation for everything else in this course.
