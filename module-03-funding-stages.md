## 📖 Core Concepts

### 3.1 — The Funding Stages Map

Think of fundraising as a series of gates. Each time you pass through a gate, you prove something, get more capital, and take on more obligations to shareholders.

```
IDEA
  │
  ▼
[Bootstrapping / Friends & Family]  ← $0 – $250K
  │
  ▼
[Pre-Seed]  ← $150K – $1M  (Angels, Accelerators)
  │
  ▼
[Seed]  ← $500K – $3M  (Seed VCs, Angel groups)
  │
  ▼
[Series A]  ← $3M – $15M  (Institutional VCs)
  │
  ▼
[Series B]  ← $15M – $50M  (VCs + Growth funds)
  │
  ▼
[Series C+]  ← $50M+  (Growth equity, Late-stage VCs)
  │
  ▼
[IPO or Acquisition]  ← Exit event
```

Each stage has different expectations. Let's go through them.

---

### 3.2 — Stage by Stage: What Investors Expect

#### 🌱 Bootstrapping / Friends & Family
- **Who invests:** Founder's own savings, friends, family
- **Amount:** Up to $250K typically
- **What you need:** An idea and the trust of people who know you
- **Risk:** Mixing personal relationships with money is dangerous — set expectations clearly

#### 🌿 Pre-Seed
- **Who invests:** Angel investors, micro-VCs, accelerators (YC, Techstars)
- **Amount:** $150K – $1M (YC currently invests $500K standard)
- **What you need to show:** A believable team, an articulated problem, and often an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or prototype
- **Key question investors ask:** "Can this team figure it out?"

#### 🌳 Seed
- **Who invests:** Seed-focused VCs, angel syndicates, super-angels
- **Amount:** $500K – $3M (sometimes up to $5M in hot markets)
- **What you need to show:** Product exists, early users, some signal of demand. Revenue not always required, but preferred.
- **Key question investors ask:** "Is there evidence people want this?"

#### 🚀 Series A
- **Who invests:** Institutional VCs (Benchmark, Sequoia, a16z, etc.)
- **Amount:** $5M – $20M
- **What you need to show:** Repeatable growth, clear business model, strong unit economics (see Module 07), a team that can execute at scale
- **Key question investors ask:** "Can this grow into a $1B+ business?"

> ⚠️ **The Series A Crunch:** A significant number of Seed-funded companies never make it to Series A. This is because Seed = "we think this could work" and Series A = "we've proven this works." The gap between those two is where many startups stall.

#### 📈 Series B
- **Who invests:** Series B VCs, some crossover funds
- **Amount:** $20M – $75M
- **What you need to show:** Proven market leadership or clear path to it, scaling operations, strong revenue growth (often 3x+ YoY)
- **Key question investors ask:** "How do we dominate this market?"

#### 🏢 Series C and Beyond
- **Who invests:** Late-stage VCs, growth equity firms, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds
- **Amount:** $75M – $500M+
- **What you need to show:** Significant revenue, path to profitability, global expansion potential
- **Key question investors ask:** "What does the IPO story look like?"

### 3.3 — Investment Instruments: How Deals Are Structured

When an investor gives you money, they need a document that says what they get in return. The three main instruments are:

---

#### Instrument 1: SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)
*Created by Y Combinator in 2013. Now the dominant early-stage instrument.*

A SAFE is **not a loan** and **not equity yet**. It is a promise: "We give you money now, and in return we get the right to convert that into equity at a future priced round."

**Key terms in a SAFE:**

**Valuation Cap:** The maximum valuation at which the SAFE converts to equity.
> Example: You raise a SAFE with a $5M cap. Later, you raise a Series A at a $20M pre-money valuation. The SAFE holder converts as if the company was worth only $5M — so they get a better price per share than new investors.

**Discount Rate:** SAFE holders often also get a percentage discount on the price paid by new investors.
> Example: 20% discount means if Series A investors pay $1.00/share, SAFE holders pay only $0.80/share.

**MFN (Most Favored Nation):** Safeguards the investor — if you offer better terms on a future SAFE, they get those terms too.

**Why founders love SAFEs:**
- Fast and cheap to execute (a few days, minimal legal fees)
- No interest accruing
- No fixed repayment deadline
- Simpler than a priced round

**Why investors are okay with SAFEs:**
- They get cap protection (the cap limits how much the company can be worth when they convert)
- Widely accepted and standardized

> 📝 **Template:** Y Combinator publishes free, standard SAFE documents at [ycombinator.com/documents](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents)

---

#### Instrument 2: Convertible Note
*The predecessor to the SAFE. Still widely used.*

A convertible note is a **loan** that converts into equity at a future event (usually the next priced round). Because it's a loan, it has:

- **Principal:** The amount borrowed
- **Interest Rate:** Typically 4–8% annually
- **Maturity Date:** The date the loan must convert or be repaid (usually 12–24 months)
- **Conversion terms:** Valuation cap and/or discount rate (same as SAFE)

**Key difference from SAFE:** The note can technically be called due at maturity if you haven't raised a new round. This gives investors leverage that SAFEs don't have.

**When are convertible notes still used?**
- When the investor specifically prefers notes (some international investors)
- When there are legal or tax reasons to prefer debt instruments
- In some geographies where SAFEs are less common

---

#### Instrument 3: Priced Round (Preferred Stock)
*The full deal. Used for Series A and beyond.*

In a priced round, the company and investors **agree on a valuation today**, and the investor receives **Preferred Stock** — a class of shares with special rights and protections.

A priced round requires:
- A formal term sheet
- Legal due diligence
- Certificate of Incorporation amendment
- Investor Rights Agreement
- Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement
- Voting Agreement

**Why preferred?** Preferred stock comes with special rights that common stock (what founders get) doesn't have. These include:
- **Liquidation preference** (they get paid back first in an exit)
- **Anti-dilution protection** (see Module 05)
- **Board representation**
- **Information rights** (access to financials)

> ⏱️ **Time and cost comparison:**
> | Instrument | Time to Close | Legal Cost |
> |-----------|--------------|------------|
> | SAFE | 1–5 days | $500–$2,000 |
> | Convertible Note | 1–2 weeks | $5,000–$15,000 |
> | Priced Round | 4–12 weeks | $30,000–$100,000+ |

### 3.4 — What Goes Into a Pitch Deck?

Raising capital requires convincing investors. The pitch deck is your primary sales tool.

**The 10-slide framework (from Sequoia's guide):**

| Slide | What It Covers |
|-------|---------------|
| 1. Problem | What urgent, painful problem are you solving? |
| 2. Solution | How do you solve it uniquely? |
| 3. Why Now | Why is this the right moment? |
| 4. Market Size | TAM, SAM, SOM (see below) |
| 5. Product | Show the thing (screenshots, demo, video) |
| 6. Business Model | How do you make money? |
| 7. Traction | Growth metrics, revenue, user numbers |
| 8. Team | Who are you and why are you the ones to win? |
| 9. Competition | Honest competitive landscape |
| 10. The Ask | How much are you raising and what will you do with it? |

**Market sizing terms explained:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The total market if you had 100% share globally
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** The portion you could realistically reach
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** What you can realistically capture in the next few years

> 💡 **Common pitch deck mistakes:**
> - Slide after slide of text — use visuals
> - "No competition" slides — every investor knows this is false
> - Vague financials — show you understand your numbers
> - Missing the ask — tell them how much you want and why

## 🌍 Real-World Case Study: Stripe's Fundraising Journey

**Stripe** is now one of the most valuable private companies in the world (valued at ~$50B+ in recent rounds). But it started like every other startup.

**2009:** Patrick and John Collison started building Stripe in their college dorms. The idea: make it radically simple for developers to accept payments online. At the time, payment processing was a nightmare.

**2010 — First Funding:** Stripe was accepted into Y Combinator (Summer 2010 batch). YC invested roughly $20K for approximately 7% (standard at the time). Pre-money implied value: under $300K.

**2011 — Seed Round:** After YC, they raised a seed round led by Peter Thiel, Sequoia, and a16z — raising $2M at a roughly $20M valuation. This was unusually high for seed at the time, reflecting the pedigree of the founders and the early evidence of developer adoption.

**2012 — Series A:** $18M raised at a $100M valuation. By now, Stripe had significant developer adoption and revenue growing rapidly.

**Why Stripe Could Raise at These Terms:**
- Founders were ex-MIT and ex-Harvard with strong technical credibility
- YC network created instant credibility signal
- The product solved a real, painful problem
- Developer-led growth was measurable and compounding

**The Instrument Choice:**
Early rounds used convertible notes. By Series A, they moved to priced preferred stock rounds — as is standard once the business and valuation are more established.

> 🤔 **Reflection Question:** Stripe raised at a $100M valuation in 2012 with around $2–3M in annual revenue. That's roughly 40x revenue. What justified such a high multiple? What data would you have wanted to see?

## 🔬 Lab Exercise: Choose the Right Instrument

**Objective:** Given three different founder scenarios, select the right fundraising instrument and explain your reasoning.

**Time:** 45–60 minutes

**Instructions:** For each scenario below, decide which instrument is most appropriate (SAFE, Convertible Note, or Priced Round) and list 2–3 reasons why.

---

**Scenario A: The First-Time Founder**
Maria has quit her job to build a healthcare scheduling SaaS tool. She has a working prototype and 3 pilot customers (not paying yet). A local angel she met at a conference wants to invest $100K. Maria needs to move quickly — she's almost out of personal savings.

*Which instrument? Why?*
*(Think about: speed, cost, her leverage, and the amount)*

---

**Scenario B: The Fast Grower**
David's FinTech startup has $800K in ARR, growing 30% month-over-month. He's getting inbound interest from multiple institutional VCs. A well-known fund is offering to lead a $6M round with a formal term sheet. His seed investors used SAFEs a year ago, and they'll convert in this round.

*Which instrument? Why?*
*(Think about: amount, investor sophistication, converting prior SAFEs, and legal structure)*

---

**Scenario C: The International Investor**
Priya's AI startup is raising $500K from a Singapore-based family office who is used to investing via debt instruments. The family office is comfortable with SAFEs but their legal team prefers convertible notes for tax reasons in Singapore.

*Which instrument? Why?*
*(Think about: investor preferences, relationship value, and flexibility)*

---

**Bonus: Draft a SAFE Summary Card**

Using the YC post-money SAFE as a template (Google: "YC post-money SAFE template"), summarize the following:
- What does the valuation cap do?
- What happens at conversion?
- What's the difference between pre-money and post-money SAFEs?

## 🔁 Module Summary (TL;DR)

Startup funding follows a predictable arc: **bootstrapping → angels → Seed → Series A → B → C → exit**. Each stage requires more proof. Early rounds use **SAFEs or convertible notes** (fast and cheap); later rounds use **priced preferred equity** (complex but full of investor protections). The pitch deck is the founder's primary sales tool — master the 10-slide framework. The right instrument depends on amount, speed, investor preferences, and company stage.
