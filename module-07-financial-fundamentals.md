## 📖 Core Concepts

### 7.1 — Burn Rate: How Fast Are You Spending?

**Burn rate** is the rate at which your company spends money beyond what it earns. It is the single most critical financial metric for any early-stage company.

**Two types:**

**Gross Burn:** Total cash spent per month on *all* expenses (salaries, rent, software, marketing, etc.)

**Net Burn:** Gross burn *minus* revenue. This is how much cash you're *actually* losing each month.

```
Net Burn = Gross Burn − Revenue
```

**Example:**
- Monthly expenses (gross burn): $200,000
- Monthly revenue: $50,000
- **Net burn: $150,000/month**

> 💡 **Which number matters?** Net burn. Gross burn tells you what you're spending; net burn tells you how fast you're dying.

**What's a "good" burn rate?**
There is no universal answer — it depends entirely on:
- How much cash you have
- Your revenue trajectory
- Whether you're growing fast enough to justify the spend
- How close you are to your next fundraise

---

### 7.2 — Runway: How Long Until You Run Out of Money?

**Runway** is how many months you can operate before you run out of cash.

```
Runway (months) = Cash in Bank ÷ Net Monthly Burn
```

**Example:**
- Cash in bank: $1,500,000
- Net burn: $150,000/month
- **Runway: 10 months**

> 🚨 **Critical Rule:** You need to start fundraising at least **6 months before you run out of money.** Raising takes time — often 3–6 months for institutional rounds. If you wait until you have 2 months of runway, you are negotiating from desperation and will get terrible terms (or no deal at all).

**The Rule of 18:**
Most experienced investors and advisors recommend maintaining at least **18 months of runway** at all times. This gives you enough time to miss a fundraise target, iterate on your business, and try again.

**Why 18 months?**
- 6 months to find and close a round
- 6 months buffer if the round slips
- 6 months of actual operating runway before panic sets in

---

### 7.3 — Unit Economics: Does Your Business Actually Work?

**Unit economics** refers to the revenue and costs associated with a single unit of your business — typically one customer.

The core question: **Does making one sale make or lose money?**

This sounds obvious, but many startups scaled massive businesses that were fundamentally unprofitable per unit — and eventually collapsed.

#### CAC: Customer Acquisition Cost

**How much does it cost to acquire one paying customer?**

```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend ÷ Number of New Customers Acquired
```

**Example:**
- You spend $100,000 on sales and marketing in Q1
- You acquire 200 new customers
- **CAC: $500/customer**

**What to include in CAC:** Sales team salaries, marketing spend, advertising, tools, events — all costs directly attributable to customer acquisition.

---

#### LTV: Lifetime Value (or Customer Lifetime Value / CLV)

**How much revenue does a single customer generate over their entire relationship with you?**

```
LTV = Average Revenue Per Customer Per Month × Gross Margin % × Average Customer Lifespan (months)
```

**Example:**
- Monthly subscription: $100/month
- Gross margin: 80%
- Average customer lifespan: 24 months
- **LTV: $100 × 80% × 24 = $1,920**

---

#### The LTV:CAC Ratio: The Most Important Unit Economics Metric

```
LTV:CAC Ratio = LTV ÷ CAC
```

Using our examples:
- LTV: $1,920
- CAC: $500
- **LTV:CAC = 3.84x**

**Interpreting the ratio:**

| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| < 1x | You're losing money on every customer. This is a crisis. |
| 1–2x | Marginally profitable per customer but likely unsustainable. |
| 3x | The gold standard for SaaS. Often cited as the minimum for VC-backable businesses. |
| > 5x | Excellent — possibly underinvesting in growth. |

> 💡 **The 3x Rule:** A healthy SaaS business should have an LTV:CAC ratio of at least **3x** and recover its CAC within **12–18 months** (called the "CAC Payback Period"). Investors will ask about this in almost every Series A pitch.

---

### 7.4 — Gross Margin: The Quality of Your Revenue

**Gross margin** is the percentage of revenue left after paying the direct costs of delivering your product or service.

```
Gross Margin % = (Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold) ÷ Revenue × 100
```

**Why it matters for startups:**
- High gross margins = more money to reinvest in growth
- Low gross margins = harder to scale, harder to raise VC

**Industry benchmarks:**

| Business Type | Typical Gross Margin |
|--------------|---------------------|
| SaaS / Software | 70–90% |
| Marketplace | 50–80% |
| Consumer App | 60–80% |
| D2C / E-commerce | 30–60% |
| Hardware | 20–50% |
| Food / Retail | 20–40% |
| Services | 20–50% |

> 🚀 **Why VCs love SaaS:** Software costs almost nothing to replicate. Once you build the product, each additional customer costs very little to serve. This creates **high gross margins** and **massive scalability** — the two things VCs love most.

---

### 7.5 — MRR and ARR: Recurring Revenue Metrics

**MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):** The predictable revenue a subscription business expects each month.

**ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue):** MRR × 12. The annualized version.

**Why recurring revenue matters:** Predictability. A company with $100K ARR growing 20% month-over-month is a very different business than one with $100K in one-time sales. VCs pay dramatically higher multiples for recurring revenue.

**Components of MRR change:**

| Component | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **New MRR** | Revenue from new customers |
| **Expansion MRR** | More revenue from existing customers (upsells, upgrades) |
| **Churned MRR** | Revenue lost from cancellations |
| **Net New MRR** | New MRR + Expansion MRR − Churned MRR |

**Churn Rate:** The percentage of customers (or revenue) you lose each month.

```
Monthly Churn Rate = Churned Customers ÷ Total Customers at Start of Month
```

> ⚠️ **Churn is a silent killer.** A 5% monthly churn rate means you lose more than **half your customers in a year**. Even moderate churn makes it impossible to compound growth.

---

### 7.6 — Reading a Basic P&L (Income Statement)

The **Profit & Loss statement (P&L)** shows revenue, costs, and profitability over a period.

**Simplified startup P&L:**

```
Revenue                          $500,000
  Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)     ($100,000)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Gross Profit                     $400,000   (80% gross margin)

Operating Expenses:
  Salaries & Benefits           ($300,000)
  Marketing & Sales             ($150,000)
  Rent & Facilities              ($30,000)
  Software & Tools               ($20,000)
  Other                          ($10,000)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total OpEx                      ($510,000)

EBITDA (Operating Loss)         ($110,000)
```

**For startups, EBITDA loss = net burn** (approximately, before cash adjustments).

## 🌍 Real-World Case Study: WeWork's Burn Rate Disaster

We met WeWork in Module 05. Here we look at the financial reality beneath the hype.

**The Business Model Problem:** WeWork signed long-term, fixed-cost office leases (typically 10–15 years). Then they subleased the space short-term to members (typically month-to-month).

This meant:
- **Fixed costs:** Multi-billion dollar obligations regardless of occupancy
- **Variable revenue:** Members could leave any month

**The Numbers (from their 2019 S-1 filing):**
- Revenue (H1 2019): $1.54 billion
- Net loss (H1 2019): $904 million
- **Net burn:** Roughly $150M/month

**The Gross Margin Problem:** WeWork's gross margin was **negative** before overhead — they were spending more on rent than they were collecting from members. This is a fundamental unit economics failure.

**What SoftBank Missed (Or Ignored):**
SoftBank valued WeWork at $47B based on:
- Top-line revenue growth (impressive)
- A narrative about being a tech company (not a real estate company)

What the public market saw:
- Terrible unit economics
- Negative gross margins
- Infinite growth requiring infinite capital
- No path to profitability

**The Lesson:** **Revenue growth without healthy unit economics is a liability, not an asset.** WeWork's revenue was impressive. Its economics were catastrophic. VCs — and especially founders — must always look at the *quality* of growth, not just the *quantity*.

> 🤔 **Reflection Question:** What three numbers would you have looked at in WeWork's financials to understand that this business model was broken?

## 🔬 Lab Exercise: Burn Rate, Runway & Unit Economics

**Objective:** Calculate burn rate, runway, CAC, LTV, and assess whether a fictional startup is fundable.

**Time:** 60–75 minutes

**Use Google Sheets or Excel for all calculations.**

---

#### Part 1: Burn Rate & Runway

**Scenario:** "MedTrack" is a B2B health tech startup with the following monthly financials:

| Expense Category | Monthly Cost |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Engineering salaries | $120,000 |
| Sales & Marketing | $45,000 |
| Rent & Facilities | $12,000 |
| Cloud/Software | $8,000 |
| Other OpEx | $5,000 |
| **Total Expenses** | **$190,000** |

**Revenue:**
- Month 1: $20,000
- Month 2: $28,000
- Month 3: $38,000
- Month 4: $52,000
- Month 5: $65,000
- Month 6: $78,000

**Cash in bank:** $1,200,000

**Your Tasks:**
1. Calculate gross burn rate (monthly)
2. Calculate net burn for each of the 6 months
3. Calculate runway as of Month 6 (using Month 6 net burn)
4. Is the runway adequate? When should they start fundraising?
5. Plot revenue and burn on a simple chart to visualize the trend

---

#### Part 2: Unit Economics

**Scenario (continued):** MedTrack sells a SaaS subscription to hospitals at $2,500/month. Their average customer stays for 18 months before churning. Gross margin is 75%. Their sales team cost $45,000/month and acquired 30 new customers over the past 6 months.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Calculate CAC
2. Calculate LTV
3. Calculate LTV:CAC ratio
4. Is this fundable? Benchmark against the 3x rule.
5. Calculate CAC Payback Period (CAC ÷ Monthly Gross Profit per Customer)
6. If MedTrack could reduce churn so the average customer stays 30 months instead of 18, what would the new LTV and LTV:CAC be?

---

#### Part 3: Investor Memo Questions

Based on your analysis, answer as if you were writing an investor memo:

1. What is the most concerning financial metric about MedTrack right now?
2. What is the most encouraging financial metric?
3. What would you need to see in the next 6 months to feel confident investing?
4. Is the current burn rate appropriate for the stage of the business?

## 🔁 Module Summary (TL;DR)

**Burn rate** (how fast you're spending) and **runway** (how long until you're out of money) are survival metrics. **Unit economics** — particularly LTV:CAC ratio — determine whether your business has a right to scale. **Gross margin** signals the quality of your revenue model. **MRR/ARR** and **churn** are the heartbeat metrics of subscription businesses. Great financials don't guarantee success, but poor financials guarantee failure — no matter how good the product is.
