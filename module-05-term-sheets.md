## 📖 Core Concepts

### 5.1 — What Is a Term Sheet?

A **term sheet** is a non-binding document that outlines the key terms of a proposed investment. It is the framework agreement that comes before the binding legal documents.

Think of it as the **"letter of intent"** in a real estate deal. Both parties agree to the broad terms, and then lawyers turn it into formal contracts.

**What a term sheet is NOT:**
- It is not a final binding contract (except for exclusivity and confidentiality clauses)
- It is not a guarantee of investment (due diligence can kill a deal)
- It is not a simple document — it can be 10–20 pages dense with legal concepts

> ⚠️ **Founder Mistake #1:** Assuming all term sheets are the same. The specific terms — especially around liquidation preferences and anti-dilution — can mean the difference between a founder walking away with $10M or $0 on the same acquisition.

---

### 5.2 — The Two Categories of Term Sheet Provisions

Term sheet terms fall into two buckets:

#### 💰 Economic Terms
These determine *how much money everyone makes*. The key ones:
- Valuation (pre-money / post-money)
- Liquidation preference
- Anti-dilution protection
- Option pool size
- Pay-to-play provisions

#### 🗳️ Control Terms
These determine *who makes decisions*. The key ones:
- Board composition
- Protective provisions (investor veto rights)
- Voting rights
- Information rights
- Drag-along rights
- Right of First Refusal (ROFR)

---

### 5.3 — Liquidation Preference (The Most Important Economic Term)

**Liquidation preference** defines how the exit proceeds are distributed. This single term can make or break a founder's outcome.

**The basics:** In a liquidity event (acquisition, IPO), preferred shareholders (investors) get paid *before* common shareholders (founders, employees).

#### Type 1: Non-Participating Preferred (Founder-Friendly)
The investor gets *either* their liquidation preference *or* their pro-rata share of the exit — whichever is higher.

**Example:**
- VC invested $5M for 25% ownership
- 1x non-participating preference = gets $5M back OR 25% of exit, whichever is more
- Company acquired for $10M
  - Preference: $5M
  - Pro-rata share: 25% × $10M = $2.5M
  - VC takes the higher: **$5M**
  - Remaining: $5M goes to common (founders/employees)

- Company acquired for $30M
  - Preference: $5M
  - Pro-rata share: 25% × $30M = $7.5M
  - VC takes the higher: **$7.5M** (they convert to common)
  - Remaining: $22.5M goes to common

#### Type 2: Participating Preferred (Investor-Friendly)
The investor gets *both* their liquidation preference *AND* their pro-rata share of the remaining proceeds. This is sometimes called "double-dip."

**Example using same scenario:**
- Company acquired for $10M with 1x participating preferred
  - Step 1: VC gets preference: **$5M**
  - Step 2: Remaining $5M split by ownership — VC gets 25%: **$1.25M**
  - Total VC gets: **$6.25M**
  - Founders get: **$3.75M** (instead of $5M with non-participating)

#### Type 3: Capped Participating Preferred
A compromise — investor participates, but their total return is capped at a multiple (e.g., 3x).

> 💡 **The founder-friendly standard:** Most standard VC deals today (especially from reputable funds) use **1x non-participating preferred**. Anything more aggressive — participating preferred, or multiples above 1x — is a red flag and worth pushing back on.

**Summary Table:**

| Exit Price | Non-Participating 1x | Participating 1x | Common (Founders) |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| $5M | VC: $5M, Common: $0 | VC: $5M, Common: $0 | $0 |
| $10M | VC: $5M, Common: $5M | VC: $6.25M, Common: $3.75M | Less with participating |
| $40M | VC: $10M (converts), Common: $30M | VC: $11.25M, Common: $28.75M | Slightly less |

### 5.4 — Anti-Dilution Protection

**Anti-dilution** protects investors if the company raises money at a *lower valuation* than the current round (a "down round").

Imagine: VC invested at a $20M pre-money. The company struggles and raises a Series B at a $10M pre-money. This is a down round — the company is worth less than when the VC invested.

Anti-dilution provisions give investors more shares to compensate for the reduced value.

**Two main types:**

#### Full Ratchet (Very Aggressive / Investor-Friendly)
The investor gets repriced to the *lowest price per share* in any future round, regardless of the new round size.

This is brutal for founders because even a tiny down round wipes out a lot of founder equity.

#### Weighted Average (Standard / More Balanced)
The investor's price is adjusted based on the *size* of the down round as well as the price. Small down rounds have a smaller impact; large down rounds have a larger impact.

Most legitimate VC deals use **weighted average anti-dilution**. Full ratchet is a red flag.

> 📋 **Quick Reference:**
> - **Weighted Average** = reasonable, standard, founder-acceptable
> - **Full Ratchet** = aggressive, founder-hostile, push back hard

---

### 5.5 — Control Terms: Who Actually Runs the Company?

#### Board Composition
The board of directors has ultimate authority over the company. Board composition determines who controls key decisions.

**Typical early-stage board setups:**

| Stage | Board Composition |
|-------|-----------------|
| Pre-Seed | 1–3 founders only |
| Seed | 2 founders + 1 investor |
| Series A | 2 founders + 2 investors + 1 independent |
| Series B+ | Negotiated — often investor-heavy |

> ⚠️ **Founders can lose control of their own company** if they don't pay attention to board composition across multiple rounds. This is how stories like Travis Kalanick at Uber happen.

#### Protective Provisions
These are investor **veto rights** — actions the company cannot take without investor approval, regardless of what the board or shareholders vote.

Common protective provisions include:
- Selling the company
- Raising new funding rounds
- Changing the certificate of incorporation
- Hiring or firing the CEO
- Taking on debt above a certain threshold
- Issuing new stock
- Declaring dividends

> 💡 **These are standard.** Most investors will have protective provisions. What matters is *how broad* they are. Watch for overly broad provisions that give VCs veto power over ordinary business decisions.

#### Drag-Along Rights
If a majority of shareholders (often majority of preferred + majority of common) want to sell the company, drag-along rights *force all other shareholders* to also sell on the same terms.

This prevents a small number of holdouts from blocking an acquisition everyone else wants.

#### Right of First Refusal (ROFR)
If a founder or employee wants to sell their shares (to another party), the company (and then investors) have the right to buy those shares first at the same price.

This keeps cap tables clean and prevents random third parties from becoming shareholders.

---

### 5.6 — Other Important Terms

**Information Rights:** Investors get access to company financials, usually quarterly or annually.

**Pro-Rata Rights:** The right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership % (covered in Module 04).

**Co-Sale Rights (Tag-Along):** If a founder sells shares, investors can sell proportionally alongside them.

**No-Shop Clause:** During due diligence, the founder cannot shop the deal to other investors. This is binding and usually lasts 30–60 days.

**Exclusivity:** Similar to no-shop. Protects the investor's time investment in due diligence.

## 🌍 Real-World Case Study: The WeWork Down Round Disaster

**Background:** WeWork was one of the most hyped startups of the 2010s. Co-working spaces, charismatic founder (Adam Neumann), and SoftBank as a major investor.

**The Valuation Peak (2019):** SoftBank valued WeWork at **$47 billion** in January 2019. This was mostly based on narrative and SoftBank's aggressive investment thesis.

**The Crash:** WeWork filed for its IPO in 2019. The S-1 filing revealed massive losses ($1.9B loss on $1.8B revenue), governance concerns, and questionable self-dealing by Neumann. Public markets were not impressed. The IPO was withdrawn. Neumann was ousted.

**The Down Round:** SoftBank had to rescue WeWork with a new investment — but at a dramatically lower valuation, eventually around **$2.9 billion** (from $47B). This was a catastrophic down round.

**What Anti-Dilution Meant Here:** Early WeWork investors had anti-dilution provisions. When the down round happened, their share counts were adjusted upward to compensate. This came entirely at the expense of common shareholders — founders and employees whose options were now drastically underwater (their strike price was higher than the current share price, making options worthless).

**WeWork's Bankruptcy (2023):** WeWork ultimately filed for bankruptcy in November 2023. Most common equity holders received nothing.

**The Lesson:**
1. Inflated valuations during bull markets create devastating down round scenarios
2. Liquidation preferences and anti-dilution clauses protect investors — not founders — in downside scenarios
3. The person who gets hurt most in a down round is almost always the employee holding stock options

> 🤔 **Reflection Question:** If you were an early WeWork employee who received options at the $47B valuation, what would your outcome have been? What does this tell you about the risk of joining a late-stage, highly-valued startup as an employee?

## 🔬 Lab Exercise: Analyze a Sample Term Sheet

**Objective:** Read and annotate a simplified term sheet, identify key terms, and flag any concerning provisions.

**Time:** 45–60 minutes

---

**Part 1: Read the Following Simplified Term Sheet**

---

*Fictitious Term Sheet — "NovaTech Series A Financing"*

**Issuer:** NovaTech, Inc.

**Investors:** Apex Ventures (lead), co-investors TBD

**Amount:** $5,000,000

**Pre-Money Valuation:** $15,000,000

**Security:** Series A Preferred Stock

**Liquidation Preference:** 2x participating preferred. Investors receive 2x their investment before any distributions to common. After the preference, investors participate pro-rata with common on the remaining proceeds.

**Anti-Dilution:** Full ratchet, adjusted in the event of any future down round.

**Board of Directors:** Board will consist of 5 members: 2 designated by investors, 2 designated by founders, 1 independent director mutually agreed upon. Founders agree that the CEO may be replaced by board vote at any time with a simple majority.

**Option Pool:** Prior to closing, the company will establish an option pool equal to 20% of the post-money fully diluted capitalization (to be created pre-money).

**Protective Provisions:** Investor approval required for: any acquisition or merger, any new equity or debt issuance, changes to compensation above $150,000/year for any employee, dividend declarations, changes to the Certificate of Incorporation.

**No-Shop:** 60 days from signing this term sheet.

**Closing:** Approximately 45 days from signing.

---

**Part 2: Answer These Questions**

1. **Valuation:** What is the post-money valuation? What % of the company does Apex Ventures receive?

2. **Liquidation Preference:** Is this founder-friendly or investor-friendly? What does the "2x participating" mean for a founder's outcome on a $20M exit vs. a $100M exit? (Model both scenarios.)

3. **Anti-Dilution:** What type is specified? Is this a red flag?

4. **Board Control:** How is the board structured? Is there a risk of founders losing control?

5. **Option Pool:** Is this pool created pre- or post-money? Who does this dilute?

6. **Protective Provisions:** Which provision concerns you the most as a founder and why?

7. **Overall Assessment:** Would you sign this term sheet? What would you push back on?

---

**Part 3: Rewrite One Term**

Choose the most aggressive term in this term sheet and rewrite it in a founder-friendlier way. Then explain what you changed and why the investor might push back.

## 🔁 Module Summary (TL;DR)

A term sheet has **economic terms** (how money is divided) and **control terms** (who makes decisions). The most important economic term is the **liquidation preference** — which determines who gets paid first and how much. Watch out for **participating preferred** and **full ratchet anti-dilution** — both are investor-friendly and can significantly reduce founder payouts. Control terms determine board composition and investor veto rights. Always have a lawyer review any term sheet before signing, and always negotiate.
