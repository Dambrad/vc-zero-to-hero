## 📖 Core Concepts

### 6.1 — Why Equity Matters for Hiring

Cash salaries at startups are often below market rate. Equity is how startups compete for talent against Google, Meta, and McKinsey.

Equity serves two purposes:
1. **Compensation:** It supplements or replaces cash pay
2. **Alignment:** It gives employees a stake in the outcome, which aligns their interests with the company's success

> 💡 **The promise of equity:** "We can't pay you market rate now, but if this company succeeds, your shares will be worth far more than the salary difference."

This promise is powerful — but employees should understand that **most startup equity ends up worth nothing**. The ones that do pay out can be life-changing.

### 6.2 — Stock Options: The Standard Employee Equity Vehicle

A **stock option** is the *right to purchase shares at a fixed price* (the "strike price" or "exercise price"), at some point in the future.

**How it works:**
1. Company grants you 10,000 options with a strike price of $1.00/share
2. You vest over time (earn the right to exercise)
3. Years later, the company exits at $20/share
4. You exercise your options: Pay $1.00 × 10,000 = $10,000
5. You receive shares worth $20.00 × 10,000 = $200,000
6. **Your profit: $190,000**

#### Two types of stock options:

**Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)**
- Available only to employees (not contractors or advisors)
- Favorable tax treatment: No regular income tax at exercise (though AMT may apply)
- Tax is triggered when you *sell*, and at capital gains rates if held long enough

**Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs / NQSOs)**
- Available to employees, contractors, advisors, and directors
- Taxed as ordinary income at exercise (the spread between strike price and FMV)
- Less favorable than ISOs from a tax standpoint

> 💡 **As a rule:** Employees typically receive ISOs. Advisors and contractors receive NSOs.

### 6.3 — Vesting: Earning Your Equity Over Time

**Vesting** is the schedule by which you earn the right to your shares. It prevents someone from joining a startup, collecting shares, and leaving the next day.

**The Standard: 4-Year Vest with 1-Year Cliff**

This is the most common structure and what most people mean when they say "standard vesting":

- **1-Year Cliff:** You receive 0% of your options until you've been at the company for exactly 1 year. On your 1-year anniversary, 25% of your options vest all at once.
- **Monthly Vesting After the Cliff:** After the cliff, the remaining 75% vests monthly (1/48th per month) over the next 3 years.

**Visual timeline:**

```
Month 0    ██████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% vested
Month 12   ████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 25% vested (CLIFF)
Month 13   ████████████████████████▌░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 27% vested
Month 24   ████████████████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ 50% vested
Month 36   ████████████████████████████████████████████████ 75% vested
Month 48   ████████████████████████████████████████████████ 100% vested
```

**Why cliffs exist:**
- Protects the company from someone who joins and leaves quickly
- Encourages commitment to the early mission
- Standard practice — not negotiable at most companies

**Acceleration:** Some agreements include acceleration clauses:
- **Single Trigger:** If the company is acquired, vesting accelerates
- **Double Trigger:** If the company is acquired *AND* the employee is let go, vesting accelerates

> 💡 **What to negotiate:** Standard vesting is rarely negotiable for most employees. Executives joining at VP level or above often negotiate for shorter cliffs, accelerated vesting, or larger initial grants.

### 6.4 — The 409A Valuation

The **409A valuation** is an independent appraisal of the company's **common stock fair market value** (FMV). It determines the strike price of new stock options.

**Why it matters:**
- The IRS requires that stock options be issued at or above FMV
- Issuing options below FMV creates immediate tax liability for the employee (Section 409A of the tax code — hence the name)
- Companies must update their 409A at least annually or after major financing events

**The relationship to the last preferred round:**
- Preferred stock (what investors get) is always worth *more* than common stock (what employees get)
- Common stock is typically valued at **20–40% of the preferred stock price** for early-stage companies
- This discount (sometimes called the "common/preferred ratio") is the employee's advantage — they buy in at a lower price than investors paid

> **Example:**
> - Series A preferred: $5.00/share
> - 409A common FMV: $1.50/share
> - Employee strike price: $1.50/share
> - If company exits at $10/share preferred, common might be worth ~$8–9/share
> - Employee profit: ~$6.50–$7.50/share (minus taxes)

### 6.5 — How Much Equity to Offer?

This is highly variable by stage, role, and market. Here are rough industry benchmarks:

#### Early Employees (Pre-Seed / Seed)

| Role | Equity Range |
|------|-------------|
| CTO / Technical Co-founder | 5–15% |
| First engineering hire | 1–3% |
| First sales hire | 0.5–1.5% |
| First marketing hire | 0.25–0.75% |
| Key advisor (experienced) | 0.1–0.5% |

#### Later Employees (Series A+)

| Role | Equity Range |
|------|-------------|
| VP Engineering | 0.5–1.5% |
| VP Sales / CMO | 0.25–1% |
| Senior Engineer | 0.1–0.25% |
| Mid-level Engineer | 0.05–0.15% |
| Advisor (post-Series A) | 0.1–0.25% |
| Board Member (Independent) | 0.1–0.5% |

> ⚠️ **These are benchmarks, not rules.** Actual grants depend on company stage, the candidate's alternatives, their track record, and market conditions.

### 6.6 — RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)

RSUs are more common at larger companies (post-Series C, pre-IPO) and public companies than early-stage startups.

An RSU is a promise to give you shares at a future date, contingent on you staying at the company (and sometimes other performance conditions).

**Key difference from options:**
- Options are the *right to buy* at a fixed price (has value only if the stock price rises above the strike price)
- RSUs are an *outright grant* of shares (always have value as long as the company has value)

**RSU Taxation:** RSUs are taxed as ordinary income when they vest — on the full value of the shares at vesting. This can create large, unexpected tax bills.

> 💡 **RSUs at late-stage startups:** Many pre-IPO companies now offer RSUs instead of options because options create tax complexities for employees. If you're evaluating an equity package at a Series D+ company, you're likely seeing RSUs.

## 🌍 Real-World Case Study: Early Google Employee Equity

**The Setup:** In 1998–2000, Google was just starting to hire. They paid below-market cash salaries but offered generous stock options. The strike prices were fractions of a cent.

**What Happened:**
- The cook at Google's first office, Charlie Ayers, received stock options as part of his compensation
- When Google went public in 2004, he reportedly exercised options worth approximately **$26 million**
- Hundreds of early Google employees became millionaires, and dozens became worth $10M+
- Employees who joined in 2003 — just one year before IPO — with senior roles had options worth millions

**The Less-Told Side:**
- Many employees who joined in 1999–2000 and left before the cliff (during the dot-com bust layoffs) received nothing
- Some employees stayed but the company required them to exercise their options quickly — creating large tax bills they couldn't always pay
- A meaningful number of early employees made life-changing money, but a larger number didn't

**What This Teaches:**
1. Equity can be genuinely life-changing — Google-level outcomes are rare but real
2. Vesting cliffs protect the company but can hurt employees who leave before the cliff through no fault of their own
3. The *quality* of the equity (strike price, company value, option type) matters as much as the number of options
4. Always understand the strike price, current 409A, and company valuation when evaluating an equity offer

> 🤔 **Reflection Question:** If someone offers you 10,000 options with a $2.00 strike price, what questions would you ask before deciding if this is a good deal?

## 🔬 Lab Exercise: Design an Equity Package

**Objective:** Design an equity grant package for a key hire at a Series A startup.

**Time:** 30–45 minutes

**Scenario:**
"NovaTech" (from Module 05) just closed their $5M Series A at a $20M post-money valuation. The cap table looks like this:

| Holder | Shares | % |
|--------|--------|---|
| Alex (CEO) | 4,000,000 | 30.8% |
| Jamie (CTO) | 3,000,000 | 23.1% |
| Seed VC | 2,000,000 | 15.4% |
| Series A VC | 2,600,000 | 20.0% |
| Option Pool | 1,400,000 | 10.8% |
| **Total** | **13,000,000** | **100%** |

**Hire #1: VP of Sales**
They are currently making $180K at a mature SaaS company. You're offering $130K (salary cut). They have 2 VP-level offers from other companies at market rate. They have a strong track record of scaling SaaS sales teams from $1M to $10M ARR.

1. How many options would you offer? (Use the benchmark table above)
2. What vesting schedule would you propose?
3. What is the strike price? (Assume the 409A is $1.50/share, reflecting the common/preferred discount)
4. Model their outcome: If the company exits at $60M in 5 years, what is their equity worth?
5. Would you include any acceleration? If so, what type?

**Hire #2: Lead Engineer (Senior)**
They are currently making $160K at a startup. You're offering $140K. Good technical skills but not a VP-level candidate.

1. How many options would you offer?
2. Calculate their outcome in the same $60M exit scenario.

**Hire #3: Part-Time Advisor**
An experienced founder with 2 exits in your industry. Will work with you 2–4 hours per month for strategic guidance.

1. How much equity would you offer? What vesting schedule would you use for an advisor?
2. Would you use ISOs or NSOs for this advisor? Why?

---

**Bonus Reflection:**
After granting the above three packages, how much of the option pool remains? Is this sustainable for the next 12–18 months of hiring?

## 🔁 Module Summary (TL;DR)

Equity is how startups attract talent they can't afford to pay in cash. **Stock options** (ISOs for employees, NSOs for advisors) give the right to buy shares at a fixed strike price. **Vesting** (typically 4 years with a 1-year cliff) ensures employees earn equity over time. The **409A valuation** sets the strike price — and must equal or exceed common stock FMV. RSUs are more common at later stages. Equity ranges vary by role and stage — always benchmark against real data, and always make sure employees understand what they're getting.
